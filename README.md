# Kogwistar × OpenClaw Governance Semantics Layer

**A canonical governance semantics layer for agent systems, with graph-native memory and runtime hooks for OpenClaw.**

This repository connects [Kogwistar](./kogwistar/) (a graph-native agent substrate) to [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) via two plugins and a FastAPI bridge. It is not just hook wiring; it is the semantic execution layer under governed agent actions. It delivers:

- **Governance hooks** — real `allow`, `block`, and `requireApproval` decisions on every tool call
- **Knowledge Graph CRUD** — create, query, redirect, and tombstone nodes/edges from CLI or agent tools
- **Embeddable bridge** — a standalone FastAPI service that any OpenClaw deployment can point at
- A **governance/event semantics layer that agent systems usually hand-wave away**
- A **backbone + semantic-events model** so execution flow and governance meaning stay separate but linked

## What is real today

- OpenClaw plugin hooks post real `before_tool_call`, `after_tool_call`, and approval-resolution payloads to the bridge.
- The bridge returns real `allow`, `block`, and `requireApproval` OpenClaw decisions.
- The bridge hosts an embedded Kogwistar `WorkflowRuntime` for governance decisioning and approval suspend/resume.
- Canonical governance events, receipts, approvals, workflow runs, and latest-state projections are persisted durably through the bridge store/service layer.
- The conversation graph carries semantic governance nodes and edges, including result and terminal completion semantics.
- The bridge exposes real KG CRUD and query endpoints under `/kg/*`, and the KG plugin exposes those as OpenClaw tools and CLI commands.
- Each governed tool call gets one canonical backbone, and semantic governance events attach to that backbone rather than replacing it.
- Two decoupled plugins:
  - `plugin-governance/` — lifecycle hook plugin (governance)
  - `plugin-kg/` — Knowledge Graph CRUD plugin

## Current scope and refinement areas

- The stack is production-capable for local and self-hosted deployments, with a deliberately simple and opinionated governance policy layer rather than a fully enterprise policy engine.
- Kogwistar is the current workflow/graph substrate. Some CDC and runtime trace details therefore follow substrate behavior, but the bridge semantics are intended to stay portable to other runtimes if the substrate changes later.
- Packaging and operator ergonomics are already usable today, but the repo is still tightening the developer/operator experience around install, rebuild, and inspection workflows.
- The graph/query layer is implemented and durable today, and the remaining work is mainly about making query surfaces, demos, and operator-facing inspection paths clearer and easier to use.

## Core Idea

The central design is:

- one canonical backbone per governed tool call
- semantic governance events attached to that backbone
- latest-state projections materialized separately from graph lineage

This means the system keeps three different things distinct:

- execution flow
- governance meaning
- operator/debug latest state

Most agent systems collapse those into one noisy stream. This repo does not.

## Packaging

### Bridge (Docker)

Build from the repo root (required — the image bundles the local `kogwistar` source and the bridge app together):

```bash
docker compose build       # builds kogwistar-bridge:local
docker compose up -d       # starts bridge on port 8799
```

### Kogwistar (Python library)

```bash
# From source (development)
pip install -e ./kogwistar[server]

# From PyPI (once published)
pip install "kogwistar[server]"
```

### OpenClaw Plugins (NPM)

```bash
cd plugin-governance && npm install && npm run build
cd ../plugin-kg && npm install && npm run build

openclaw extension add ./plugin-governance
openclaw extension add ./plugin-kg
```

---

## Main Runtime Flow

```text
OpenClaw runtime
  -> plugin-governance hook
  -> bridge /policy/before-tool-call
  -> bridge canonicalization and durable store updates
  -> Kogwistar workflow runtime evaluates policy
  -> bridge returns `allow`, `block`, or `requireApproval`
  -> OpenClaw executes, blocks, or suspends
  -> bridge records completion or approval resolution
  -> Kogwistar runtime resumes when approval is granted or denied
```

---

## Development Notes

- Treat OpenClaw as an external immutable runtime boundary.
- Prefer Gateway subscriptions, operator APIs, and compiled runtime surfaces over patching OpenClaw internals.
- Use port **8799** for the bridge. Port 8788 is reserved by host-level processes.
- See [`pitfall.md`](./pitfall.md) for known gotchas around Pydantic, port conflicts, and plugin caching.
